# 1st International Workshop on Human-Centric Approaches and Practices for DevOps (HAPi DevOps)
## A VL/HCC 2022 Workshop Proposal

DevOps is a mindset and set of practices based on fostering the communication and collaboration between those more concerned with software development (Dev) and those concerned with operations (Ops). The practices that compose it extent to collaboration aspects and organizational and team design, but also to technical aspects that range from deployment automation, to monitoring and observability, and to software architecture, among others.

Despite its many benefits DevOps still presents many challenges when it comes to its ease of use and accessibility. One of the reasons is the tremendous proliferation of different tools, languages and syntaxes which makes the field quite difficult to learn and keep up to date.

This being the first workshop of its kind we believe its main goal should be to bring together the DevOps and the VL/HCC communities so the former can expose their problems and the latter can understand them and start thinking about how to help in solving existing challenges. Thus, we intend to organize an event where people can discuss problems and point to possible paths of solutions. 


## Submission

We motivate researchers and practitioners to submit their work (possibly in progress) about this topic to be presented and discussed at the workshop. You can also submit open issues deserved to be discussed as well as position papers. 

Submissions will be up to 4 pages 

Each submission will be reviewed by the organizers and the program committee mostly to validate the adequacy of the submission to the workshop. 

The list of interesting topics include (not limited to though):

- low-code/no-code solutions for DevOps
- visual notations for DevOps
- modeling DevOps technologies and pipelines
- leveraging understanding of text-based specification/IaC languages
- understanding and improving DevOps teams communication
- understanding current practices
